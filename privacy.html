                        </strong><br>
                        This Policy sets out the manner in which NoGroup Pty (LTD) handles personal

                        <strong>2. Definitions </strong><br>
                        "personal information" is as defined in the Promotion of Access to Information Act No
                        2 of 2000 ("PAIA")
                        "user" means any person accessing any part of the web site
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>3. Status </strong><br>
                        This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms and Conditions of Use of this website.
                        Continued use of this website means you agree to the provisions of this Policy and are
                        bound by them. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>4. Collection of anonymous data </strong><br>
                        In order to provide the best possible and most relevant service, we may use standard
                        technology to collect information about the use of this site. This technology is not able
                        to identify individual users but simply allows this web site to collect statistics.
                        In order to do this we use cookies. A cookie is a small file that is placed on your hard
                        drive in order to keep a record of your interaction with this web site and will log:
                        The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our website. An IP address is
                        the unique number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using
                        whenever you are surfing the web.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The type of browser (such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla) and operating system (such
                        as Windows Vista or MacOS) used to access our site.
                        The date and time when the website is accessed, for the purpose of traffic and
                        statistical monitoring.
                        The pages visited, for the purpose of improving the usefulness of our website by
                        providing helpful links and removing pages that are not read.
                        If you do not wish cookies to be employed it is possible to alter the manner in which
                        your browser handles cookies. Please note that, if this is done, certain services on this
                        web site may not be available. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>5. Email communications </strong><br>
                        When you send us personally identifying information in an e-mail, we use the
                        information you provide only to help us gather the information you might request. In
                        an effort to respond to your request, information you submit may be viewed by various
                        people within NoGroup Pty (LTD). Once received, the information to your e-mail is
                        protected in accordance with this Policy. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>6. Collection of personal data </strong><br>
                        We collect only what is necessary and use it only for the purpose for which it is
                        required.
                        We will neither sell your personal information to anyone nor otherwise dispose of it to
                        a third party otherwise than as set out in the Policy. We will not attempt to obtain your
                        permission to do so by deceptive means.
                        If we do not need it anymore, we will delete any personal information held.
                        We neither store nor retain any credit card information.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>7. Access to personal data </strong><br>
                        If you believe that your personal data which we may have is outdated or incorrect
                        please ask us to correct‚Äê please use our contact page. Please provide us with all the
                        information we need to make the correction.
                        You can also request access to any relevant personal data held by the web site owner
                        as laid out in the Promotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000 ("PROATIA") and
                        where such access is necessary for you to exercise and/or protect any of your rights.
                        We think that it will probably be simpler for you to just send us an e-mail asking for the
                        information you need.
                        <br>

                        third-party sites to which hyperlinks may have been provided and we strongly
                        recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site you visit before using it
                        further. <br>
